## Code

The figures can be rendered into an interactive HTML document running `sh build.sh`. The live version is hosted at (https://shahcompbio.github.io/spectrum-tme/index.html)[https://shahcompbio.github.io/spectrum-tme/index.html].

The source code contains RMarkdown notebooks to reproduce the manuscript figures. These are found in the `notebooks/` directory.
